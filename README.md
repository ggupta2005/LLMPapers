#### [**“Are Large Language Models a Threat to Digital Public Goods? Evidence from Activity on Stack Overflow” by Maria del Rio-Chanona, Nadzeya Laurentsyeva, and Johannes Wachs1**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.07367.pdf)

- The paper investigates how the release of ChatGPT, a large language model that can answer questions on various topics, affected the activity on Stack Overflow, a popular online platform where computer programmers ask and answer questions. The paper compares the activity on Stack Overflow with similar platforms for mathematics and other languages, where ChatGPT is less capable or accessible. The paper finds that after the release of ChatGPT, the activity on Stack Overflow decreased by 16%, and this effect increased over time and was larger for more popular programming languages. The paper argues that this implies that more users are using ChatGPT as a substitute for Stack Overflow, and that this reduces the amount of public knowledge available on the web. The paper also discusses the implications of this trend for future research and learning, both for humans and machines.
